For example, imagine having to solder on something **WITHOUT** a soldering iron. How in the world would you do that?! I’m not an engineer myself but I’m going to share with you few essential tips and tricks that I learned (googled) along my Arduino journey that helped me finish the project and save me weeks of trouble. I’m hoping you’ll find these tips useful as well. \n",

    "Multimeters are by far the most useful and most important debugging tool you’ll have while finishing this project (or any electrical engineering project). If you don’t have one at hand, stop reading this right now and order one on Amazon. Seriously. It’s that important. [Amazon Link to Multimeter](https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Voltage-Tester/dp/B01ISAMUA6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=multimeter&qid=1571619926&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFINUcyVlJPTUk2S0gmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA4NTQ4Mzg1U0pNUlYxREUzN0QmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDAzNzc5MTNNMU05T1dXRVhWMEQmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimeters can measure a lot of things including continuity, resistance, voltage, current, capacitance etc. But the most useful functionality (in my opinion) is the continuity / diode testing mode. This functionality allows you to check if a diode is working or not (which has directionality), and whether two points in a circuit are electrically connected or not. The multimeter will beep (output of a piezo buzzer) if the two points are connected and will light up the LED if the cathode is connected to GND and anode is connected to PWR. But always remember to turn the knob to continuity / diode testing mode before testing anything! Otherwise the multimeter would be powered off… \n",
