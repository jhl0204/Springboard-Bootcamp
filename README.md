# Springboard Data Science Career Track


### Introduction

This is the repository of mini assignments and projects I completed for the [Springboard Data Science Career Track](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track) program. Capstone Projects, which combine most, if not all of the technical skills and concepts learned from these projects, can be found in the following separate repositories. 

[Capstone 1: Predicting H1-B Visa Status for Applicants]()   

[Capstone 2:]() (In progress)
